# Measured progress

Tested on Windows on October 14-15, 2026. This is an experimental port bring-up;
full gameplay and campaign completion have not been verified.

## Focused native combat smoke test — October 15

- Continued on `mac-port` with the same native binary and isolated test profile.
  Traversed the initial canyon beyond the spawn area, reached the first enemy
  encounter, fired both handguns, observed ammunition consumption and enemies
  falling, and saw the accompanying marines advance. The world remained visible.
  This was an automated smoke test, not a human playthrough.
- Used temporary I/J/K/L aim and O fire bindings in the isolated test configuration
  for reproducible SDL input. Restored the fixture afterward. Personal saves and
  settings were not used or created. During inspection, waited for a fresh
  rotating frame; stale captures had made some turns appear inconsistent.
- The user narrowed the scope before full-level completion. The test was stopped
  intentionally with native exit 0; the runner reports an early `process_exit`
  rather than a passed timed probe. No new gameplay/rendering blocker was confirmed
  in this coverage. The 477-second session reached at least 8,400 guest frames
  and host presents, with no native fault or sampled GL error.
  Full-level completion, checkpoint reload, campaign save/load,
  audio fidelity and physical-controller play remain unverified.
- Extended the runner's explicit duration ceiling to 30 minutes, retaining its
  15-second default, isolated paths, two rotating captures and 8 MiB log limit.
  Portable regressions: **16 passed, 2 Windows-only checks skipped, 7 subtests**.
  No renderer/runtime source changed, so the native binary was not rebuilt.
- Evidence: `logs/native-combat-validation.json` and
  `private/captures/native-mac/first-combat-smoke.png`. Disposable partition images
  were recycled after the run.

## Visible native first-level gameplay — October 15

- Fixed the black world on `mac-port`. A per-draw GPU trace showed the world
  rendered correctly, then a later clear erased it. The game switches to a
  **160×120 offscreen texture** for that pass; the Mac backend previously returned
  no surface from `GetSurfaceLevel` and ignored `SetRenderTarget`, so the clear
  landed on the visible back buffer.
- Added real texture surfaces, OpenGL framebuffers and depth/stencil attachments,
  reference-counted target ownership, a persistent device depth surface, target
  viewport reset, rectangle/viewport clear clipping, back-buffer readback while
  an offscreen target is bound, and correct texture orientation on sampling.
  Failed/incomplete target changes preserve the prior target. These changes are
  confined to the native Mac backend; shared upstream patches and generated
  game C are unchanged.
- Reviewed actual first-level captures after the opening animation: canyon,
  enemies, dual pistols, crosshair and ammunition HUD stay visible. Forward
  input changed the viewpoint; firing reduced both pistols from **16 to 15**.
  Captured OS mouse deltas turned the view from the canyon toward a rock wall.
  Pause/resume returned to the visible world. These are bounded checks using
  SDL test input and macOS CoreGraphics events, not a human full-level playthrough.
- Added GPU regressions for offscreen clear isolation, top/bottom sampling,
  rectangle clears and preserving the old target after an incomplete attachment.
  All GPU/input checks and three native CTests pass. Portable checks:
  **16 passed, 2 Windows-only checks skipped, 7 subtests passed**. Windows
  build/runtime checks remain unrun on this host.
- Added `Play-Native-Mac.command` for interactive play with the native binary.
  It verifies ARM64/XBE/build hashes, preserves personal settings, strips stale
  test overrides and bounds logs to 8 MiB total. Its read-only readiness check
  passes. The interactive launcher was not used for automated game testing;
  personal save/settings paths remain untouched.
- The 120-second exact-binary gameplay probe completed at least **2,700**
  guest frames and host presents, with no native fault or sampled GL error.
  Its last render-target summary recorded **16,206 switches, zero failures**.
  Disposable test images were recycled; selected captures stay under `private/`.
- Evidence: `logs/mac-world-build-and-tests.log`, `logs/mac-world-portable-tests.log`,
  `logs/native-world-validation.json`, `logs/native-fixed-world-draw.txt`, and
  `private/captures/native-mac/world-playtest.png` / `world-resumed.png`.
- Remaining limits: full-level completion, campaign save/load, audio fidelity,
  physical controllers and complete renderer fidelity are unverified. The
  vertex programs still execute on the CPU; general multitexturing, cube/depth
  textures and screen-copy effects need further work. This is a first-level
  gameplay milestone, not a finished Mac release.

## Native Mac controls and first story-level load — October 15

- Added a Mac-only SDL event bridge to the shared JSON binding reader through
  `zzzz-mac-input.patch`. Keyboard/mouse state is published atomically for guest
  worker polls. Main-thread Cocoa events handle focus loss, mouse capture and
  window close. A new launch raises the game window once; it does not steal
  focus back during play. Windows control code and generated game C are unchanged.
- Confirmed the real menu flow: player selection, isolated profile creation,
  storage selection, main menu, Story, **2401: Time to Split**, difficulty,
  briefing and loading. Up/down changed selection. The isolated profile survived
  a new process and was selected again. This is profile persistence only, not
  campaign save/load validation.
- SDL event injection exercised the binding-to-XInput path. Separately, macOS
  CoreGraphics keyboard events delivered through the OS opened the in-level
  pause menu with Escape, moved its selection with Down and resumed with Escape.
  This verifies OS event delivery, not a human keyboard/controller playtest.
- The first level rendered its opening 3D scene and reached an ammunition HUD,
  but the gameplay world became black. No full playability, movement/collision,
  combat or rendering-fidelity claim is made. Renderer gaps remain the immediate
  blocker after menu navigation and level startup.
- F1 toggles relative mouse capture; Escape/focus loss releases it. The shared
  mouse enabled/sensitivity/invert settings are read at startup. The first free
  SDL controller shares keyboard player 1 without taking pads assigned to other
  players. Physical mouse look and hardware-controller play remain unverified.
- Native regression checks pass for key press/release, arrow/WASD bindings,
  focus neutralization, mouse buttons/deltas/settings and SDL virtual-controller
  hotplug/sharing. All three CTests and the real-GPU regression pass. Portable
  checks: **13 passed, 2 Windows-only checks skipped, 7 subtests passed**.
  Windows build/runtime tests were not run on this Mac.
- Repeated bounded 120-second menu/level probes completed without a native fault
  or sampled GL error. The final focused 100-second run logged at least 1,800
  guest frames and host presents and again reached the level. Window-close
  handling now exits cleanly at the probe's
  time limit (exit 0), without the former forced kill. Each probe uses
  `private/test-saves/native-mac`; known disposable partition images are recycled.
  Personal saves and settings remain unused and unchanged.
- Evidence: `logs/mac-input-build-and-tests.log`, `logs/mac-input-patch-tests.log`,
  `logs/native-input-validation.json`, `logs/native-level-summary.json`,
  `logs/native-boot-summary.json`,
  `private/captures/native-mac/menu-navigation.png` and
  `private/captures/native-mac/native-pause-navigation.png`,
  `private/captures/native-mac/first-native-level.png` and
  `private/captures/native-mac/native-gameplay-hud.png`.

## First visible native Mac menu — October 15

- On `mac-port`, connected the existing shared HLE graphics hooks to an Apple
  Silicon SDL3/Cocoa OpenGL 4.1 backend. The driver reports **GL 4.1 Metal - 91.7,
  GLSL 4.10**. The executable is native ARM64 Mach-O, with no Wine/Rosetta process.
- Visually reviewed actual GPU back-buffer captures: the TimeSplitters logo,
  animated menu background, **1 PLAYER / 2 PLAYER / 3 PLAYER / 4 PLAYER**, and
  **A Select** are readable. Repeated bounded runs reached this menu without a
  native fault. The final 45-second probe logged at least 2,100 guest frames
  and host presents, with no sampled GL errors; termination at the limit needed
  SIGKILL after the three-second grace period. This establishes the first visible
  menu; no input was injected,
  and menu navigation or gameplay is not claimed.
- Reused the shared vertex declarations, guest state mapping and texture cache.
  Added CPU execution of NV2A vertex programs with screen-space conversion,
  GLSL register-combiner evaluation, quad triangulation, Xbox texture unswizzling,
  DXT and A8 font texture uploads, and GPU readback. The loading worker exposed
  a missing current-context fault; a recursive lock now hands the context between
  guest threads. Cocoa window creation/event pumping remain on the main thread.
- Added a separate reproducible `zzz-mac-renderer.patch`; prior patches and
  generated game code remain unchanged. The Mac backend is `src/native/renderer_gl.c`;
  the existing Windows and Linux backend source selection remains intact.
  Shared portable format helpers compile from the pinned upstream source.
- Real GPU regression checks pass for quad coverage, A8 unswizzling and alpha
  blending, a synthetic NV2A vertex program, per-stage combiner constants,
  readback, and worker-thread context handoff. The three native CTest suites
  pass. Portable patch/launcher/isolation checks: 13 passed, 2 Windows-only
  PowerShell checks skipped, 7 subtests passed. The Windows executable was not rebuilt or tested.
- The probe supports `--capture`, with two rotating BMPs, isolated save/settings
  paths, bounded run/log size and validated partition-image recycling. Its JSON
  separates guest frames, sampled successful host presents, sampled GL errors,
  and capture hashes; visual menu recognition is recorded separately. Personal
  saves/settings remain unused. Project physical allocation remains about 8.5 GiB,
  with a 258 MiB native build and about 2 MiB of selected/rotating captures.
- Evidence: `private/captures/native-mac/first-native-menu.png`,
  `logs/native-boot-summary.json`, `logs/native-renderer-validation.json`,
  `logs/mac-renderer-build-and-tests.log`, and `logs/mac-renderer-patch-tests.log`.
- Remaining renderer gaps include general multi-texturing, offscreen render
  targets, screen-copy effects, movie playback and full 3D fidelity. Native
  controls/navigation, audible quality/latency, PC display/texture features,
  gameplay, fullscreen and save/load are not verified. Vertex programs currently
  execute on the CPU; a menu result is not a performance claim for gameplay.

## First native Apple Silicon execution — October 15

- Built `build/macos/futureperfect_recomp` as a native ARM64 Mach-O executable
  on macOS 27.0.1 with Apple Clang 21, Python 3.12 and the shared pinned runtime,
  Python dependencies and SDL submodule. No Wine, Rosetta or Windows process
  participates in the native runs. The verified US XBE was regenerated locally.
- A bounded 30-second run loaded all 23 XBE sections, resolved all 151 kernel
  imports, initialized the game's graphics device successfully, loaded game
  assets, ran worker threads and completed at least 1,800 guest frame calls.
  No native fault was recorded. The runner stopped it at the time limit;
  SIGTERM did not exit within the three-second grace period, so it used SIGKILL.
  This is **game-code execution without a connected host renderer**: no menu
  image, game window, gameplay, physical controls or save/load was verified.
- The first attempt exposed missing related address mappings. The Mac now
  reserves one 4 GiB virtual range and maps only its own unused pages; all 28
  low-RAM aliases, contiguous memory, device apertures and tiled alias mapped.
  It does not weaken macOS protections or overwrite unrelated host mappings.
- Implemented native relative/absolute and periodic waitable timers, and an
  ARM64 signal handler for supported scalar MMIO loads/stores. Protected NV2A
  interrupt writes and AC97 reset writes have real-signal regression coverage;
  unsupported instructions stop with diagnostics instead of being skipped.
  Read/write aliases let handlers update device backing without opening the
  protected guest page to concurrent writes. APU accesses use the existing
  device model, whose DSP implementation remains incomplete upstream.
- Implemented POSIX sparse partition images with the existing retail geometry,
  partition-device path routing, volume-directory opens and relative file opens.
  Existing image contents are preserved. These fixed the guest's early request
  to return to the Xbox dashboard. Isolated title metadata was created under
  `private/test-saves/native-mac`; personal saves were not used.
- Added an SDL3 PCM output backend and reused the portable controller-binding
  path. SDL audio output opened and PCM submissions occurred. Audible quality,
  latency and physical input remain unverified; audio uses the existing
  wall-clock fallback rather than claiming a hardware playback cursor. Movies
  are skipped because the native movie/renderer path is not connected.
- The initial graphics probe exposed an additional upstream settings fallback
  at `~/.config/xboxrecomp/titles/45410066.conf`. Its newly created default was
  moved into the isolated test directory. The probe now explicitly routes
  `RECOMP_DISPLAY_CONFIG`, `TSFP_DISPLAY_CONFIG`, input, saves and XDG roots;
  regression tests cover stale override removal and protection of personal paths.
- Three native CTest suites pass: mapping/threads/events/timers, ARM64 MMIO,
  and save/partition routing. Portable checks: 12 passed, 2 Windows-only
  PowerShell tests skipped, 7 subtests passed. Fresh application, upgrades,
  CRLF inputs, conflicts and repeat application of the complete patch stack
  pass. The actual Windows executable was not rebuilt or tested on this Mac.
- The shared rules now distinguish the retained Windows compatibility build
  from one active native build in `build/macos`. Native build provenance is
  recorded in its ignored `BUILD.json`; runtime changes are reproducible from
  `patches/zz-mac-native-boot.patch`, applied after the existing feature stack.
- Native tests recycled their known disposable partition images. The game
  probe's six images had 5,243,406,848 logical bytes but only 135,168 allocated
  bytes; the images are no longer in the project. Metadata/configuration and
  diagnostic logs remain. Physical project allocation is approximately 8.5 GiB,
  including the original ISO, the single game extract, dependencies and builds;
  `build/macos` is approximately 256 MiB.
- Evidence: `logs/native-boot.out`, `logs/native-boot.err`,
  `logs/native-boot-summary.json`, `logs/mac-native-build-and-tests.log`,
  and `logs/mac-native-patch-tests.log`. Earlier feasibility notes below are
  historical and are superseded by this native execution result.

### Next native milestone

The first-menu renderer connection is complete (see the newer result above).
Validate physical input and menu navigation, then extend rendering support for
an in-game scene. Movie presentation, PC settings/display/texture features and
save/load remain separate milestones. The earlier execution-only observations
in this section describe the state before the renderer connection.

## Native Mac feasibility and ISO preparation — October 15

- Work is on `mac-port`; the user requires changes from this chat to stay on
  that branch unless explicitly directed to `main`.
- Validated the supplied 4,047,372,288-byte ISO's embedded executable against
  the supported US SHA-256. Moved the original into ignored `private/discs`
  and extracted one copy: 412 files, 4,046,110,016 bytes, in `private/game`.
  Extraction paths/sizes were checked and the extracted executable rehashed.
  `private/disc.json` and `logs/iso-verification.json` record the checks.
- This supersedes the missing-data blocker below. The CrossOver prerequisite
  check now passes; no Mac game-play validation was performed in this pass.
- Checked out the exact pinned runtime revision under `external/ts3FPrecomp`.
  Found a reproducible patch-installation failure on its CRLF CMake source.
  Made patch context whitespace handling explicit, avoiding reliance on the
  Windows machine's Git settings. The complete patch stack now applies and a
  second pass changes zero files. Conflict protection and CRLF tests pass.
- Added `mac-platform.patch`: the upstream Apple anonymous-mapping function
  returned descriptor 0 instead of creating a backing file. The native test
  failed before this fix and passes afterward. The patch uses an owned file
  descriptor, leaves no named backing file, and is restricted to `__APPLE__`.
- Compiled and ran an actual ARM64 Mach-O test with Apple Clang 21 on macOS
  27.0.1. It verifies 64 MiB aliased mappings, bidirectional data coherence,
  non-destructive collision rejection, a worker thread and event signaling.
  This runs without Wine/CrossOver/Rosetta. The initial low-address-linker
  experiment was terminated before useful output; the passing test uses the
  normal executable layout and OS-selected addresses. It does not establish
  that the full Xbox address-space mapping is ready.
- The native path-routing source passes a Clang syntax check. The memory-layout
  and kernel-bridge sources still fail on Windows process-affinity/timer APIs.
  Further source review found Windows-only title startup/graphics hooks,
  missing POSIX HLE audio/input implementations, an incomplete OpenGL renderer,
  a Windows-wired Vulkan backend, and Linux `.so` names in the non-Windows
  FFmpeg loader. Native game boot, rendering and gameplay are **not built or
  verified**. No platform support claim is inferred from the upstream README.
- Portable checks: 8 passed, 2 Windows-only PowerShell tests skipped, 7 subtests
  passed, using Python 3.12 and pinned pytest 9.1.1. Native evidence is in
  `logs/native-platform-before.*`, `logs/native-platform-after.*`, and
  `logs/native-kernel-compile-summary.json`. Personal saves and settings were
  not used. No disposable virtual disk images were created.

## Mac compatibility preparation — October 15

- On an Apple Silicon Mac running macOS 27.0.1, the installed CrossOver 26.3
  successfully ran a Windows command. Rosetta execution and CrossOver's
  conversion of this checkout's path were checked.
- Created one Windows 10 64-bit bottle, `TimeSplitters-Future-Perfect`, and
  selected D3DMetal. The bottle uses approximately 309 MiB of physical space
  outside the project. No Windows VM was created.
- Verified public release `v0.1.0-alpha.1` against archive SHA-256
  `01cb329cdda18064f7c23b1afe8c8dfa0ac0d64b31eff7fcd93901caa5259de5`, then
  verified individual runtime hashes. Installed only runtime files, licenses,
  and the build manifest under `build/windows/Release` (approximately 128 MiB).
  No ZIP, duplicate game extraction, or release staging directory was retained.
  This release records source commit `89b6063`, not the reviewed `dc0a606` tree.
- The actual executable loaded, printed its startup banner, and reached its
  missing-game-data error with no missing-library error in the captured log.
  The diagnostic run was stopped after 15 seconds using a targeted task kill
  in this dedicated bottle. It used `private/test-saves/mac-compatibility`;
  no personal saves/settings were created or used and no virtual disks appeared.
  Evidence: `logs/mac-compatibility-probe.out` and `.err`.
- Added `Play-Mac.command` and `tools/play-mac.py` with game-version validation,
  Windows-path conversion, preserved interactive save/config locations, and a
  read-only `--check`. Three focused launcher tests pass, including path names
  containing spaces, removal of stale replay/capture overrides, and rejection
  of invalid mouse settings. Shell syntax and diff whitespace checks pass.
- **Blocked on game-data transfer:** this checkout has no `private/game`, and
  the user confirmed it is only on the other computer. Mac graphics, movies,
  audio, mouse capture, menus, gameplay, fullscreen and save/load remain
  unverified. The missing-data startup probe does not establish playability.

## Display settings and texture preview — October 15

- The working build now adds **Display settings** through the US game's own
  button builder in main Settings and paused Options. Resolution selection,
  Apply, Keep and Revert all use guest menu widgets and navigation.
- 1080p, 1440p, 4K and monitor-reported modes are offered. Rendering targets and
  depth buffers resize live; a 15-second unconfirmed preview returns to the old
  resolution. Confirmed settings persist beside the PC input configuration.
- The US camera wrapper updates the perspective matrix and horizontal CPU
  frustum together. The HUD retains its proportions in a centered 4:3 region.
  Front-end menus retain the original layout. Fullscreen remains Alt+Enter.
- The actual-menu replay verified 1080p apply/save, 1440p preview, timeout
  rollback, and return to the original menu. Native tests cover resolution
  bounds, monitor-mode deduplication, failed allocation handling at the API
  boundary, aspect calculations and persistence. Original game files, saves
  and keyboard/mouse configuration passed 424 protected-file hash comparisons.
- First-mission runs rendered 3840×2160 and 3440×1440 scene buffers and reached
  paused Options without a recorded crash or unresolved indirect call. The
  resolution checks use GPU render targets on the available display; a physical
  ultrawide monitor, split screen, and a full campaign are not validated.
- The expanded texture preview contains 11 replacements, approximately 44 MiB,
  covering selected terrain, masonry, timber, concrete, floor tiles, metal panels
  and one weapon atlas. Four replacements loaded in a 174-second opening-mission
  run at 1920×1080; gameplay and paused Options were reached without a recorded
  crash or unresolved call. The remaining seven need scene-specific runtime checks.
- DDS files have complete mip chains: two 4096×4096, eight 2048×2048, and one
  2048×1024. Square source art is 1254×1254; stone masonry is 1774×887. These are
  resampled outputs, not native 4K generated art. A character draft shifted facial
  and ear UV details and was kept out of the active pack.
- The coverage audit tracks 5,547 supported texture keys: 11 installed, one draft
  requiring correction/review, and 5,535 awaiting art. Another 753 cataloged
  payloads use unsupported formats. Embedded textures may remain undiscovered.
  This is not a completed game remaster. Eight offline tool tests pass; installed
  DDS hashes, dimensions and mip chains pass the audit. All 427 protected game,
  save and settings files matched their pre-test hashes; temporary disks and
  frame captures were recycled. Exact new prompts and real source sizes are saved.
- Pack compilation enforces the user's 6 GiB cap including metadata. Runtime
  replacement residency remains capped at 512 MiB. The supported-asset size plan
  is approximately 2.5 GiB before source art and unsupported-format additions;
  the plan is not completed artwork or a guarantee of final full-game size.
- Runtime changes are reproducible from the pinned upstream revision using
  `pc-controls.patch`, `save-routing.patch`, and `texture-pack.patch`; the last
  patch includes the renderer wiring shared by display and texture features.
  Fresh application in setup order and repeat-build checks pass.

## Completed

- Read the supplied desktop Xbox ISO without modifying it; extracted 412 files.
- Confirmed the US executable, title ID `45410066`, entry point `0038024D`,
  XDK 5849 and the expected SHA-256 documented in `README.md`.
- Identified 379 Xbox library symbols, including six upstream manual symbols.
- Generated 15,838 C function bodies with zero reported translation failures,
  totaling 2,507,843 lines across 16 chunks plus support files.
- Built `build/windows/Release/futureperfect_recomp.exe` with Visual Studio
  2022 / MSVC 19.44.35224 for Windows x64.
- Compiled and loaded FFmpeg 8.1 movie support.
- Fixed native profile device paths that bypassed `RECOMP_SAVE_DIR`, and
  preserved the fix in `patches/save-routing.patch`. Ten native path regression
  checks pass, including asset routing and switching between save directories.
- Added player-1 keyboard/mouse controls: normalized WASD movement, Windows raw
  relative mouse motion, direct camera-angle updates, mouse buttons and wheel,
  editable sensitivity/invert-Y settings, focus-loss clearing and cursor
  capture/release. The launcher loads `config/pc-controls.json`.
- Preserved the host integration and camera wrapper in `patches/pc-controls.patch`;
  the generated original `sub_000D2B80` body remains available as `_gen`.

## Validation

- Upstream Python suite: 547 passed, 41 skipped, 87 subtests passed.
- Upstream unittest discovery: 289 tests passed, including 26 skipped.
  This overlaps the pytest suite and is not an additional independent total.
- CPU differential conformance: 5,741 instruction vectors and 211 function
  vectors, zero mismatches.
- First 35-second startup test: decoded the EA and Free Radical intro movies
  (88 and 81 pictures), submitted PCM movie sound, reached the rendered
  player-count menu, and remained running until the test stopped it.
  No crash or unresolved indirect call was logged. Frame captures were
  inspected, including the player-count menu.
- Second 35-second input test: scripted A presses reached profile name entry;
  the captured name-entry screen was inspected.
- A subsequent 70-second test reached Story difficulty selection. It also
  exposed profile contamination through the original runtime's save-path bug.
  Earlier test profiles are preserved in `private/pre-fix-test-saves`.
- After fixing save routing, a fresh 100-second run created its profile under
  the requested test save directory, reached the first mission briefing, loaded
  `2401: Time to Split`, and rendered its opening cutscene and the landing scene.
  No crash or unresolved indirect call was logged; 3,578 function entries were
  observed. These scenes were inspected in captured frames.
- A 260-second fresh-save run reached first-person gameplay in the first mission
  and remained running until the test's time limit, with no logged crash or
  unresolved indirect call. It reached 3,855 instrumented functions.
  Scripted movement/look input changed the viewpoint, and trigger input reduced
  the displayed dual-weapon ammunition from 16 rounds per weapon to 14 and 13.
  Level geometry, textures, weapons, crosshair and ammunition display were
  inspected in the captured frames. This is a short gameplay check, not a
  completed mission or campaign playthrough.
- The final incremental build and native save-path tests also passed through
  Windows PowerShell 5.1, the same shell used by `Play.cmd`.
- Native PC input tests cover input clearing on focus/capture changes, consuming
  a recapture click, wheel press/release sequencing, equal mouse counts across
  different polling intervals, FOV scaling, vertical limits, inverted Y,
  normalized diagonal movement, and the actual bindings/guest-camera adapter.
- A 155-second run driven by the PC input model navigated menus with Enter,
  reached first-person gameplay, moved with W, applied raw-count camera changes,
  fired/reloaded, and switched weapons with the wheel. It ended at the test
  limit without a logged crash or unresolved indirect call. This used the
  adapter's deterministic event replay, not physical desktop input injection.
- A fresh-checkout fixture verifies that both local patches apply in Setup's
  order and reproduce all seven modified upstream files.
- A second 150-second run used the corrected aim/crouch bindings and reached
  3,874 instrumented functions with no logged crash or unresolved indirect call.
  Right-mouse aiming reduced the FOV from 55 to 30.25; a 20-count mouse event
  then changed yaw by 1.1 degrees, confirming the expected 0.55 zoom multiplier.
- The final build, both native test suites, and a six-second launcher startup
  test passed through Windows PowerShell 5.1 after the cursor activation fix.

Test output is in `logs/toolchain-tests.log`, `logs/pytest.log`,
`logs/conformance.log`, `logs/build.log`, and the timestamped smoke-test logs.
`logs/gameplay-smoke-summary.log` records the 260-second run;
`logs/final-build-check.log` records the final build and path checks.
PC input work is recorded in `logs/pc-final-bindings-build.log`,
`logs/pc-gameplay-summary.log`, and the newer `logs/pc-final-gameplay-summary.log`.
The final delivered build checks are `logs/pc-release-validation.log` and
`logs/pc-launcher-smoke.log`.
Original graphics captured by tests remain local in `private/captures`.

## Remaining work

- Verify mission progression, combat against enemies, control fidelity,
  profile reloads/checkpoints and sustained play beyond the short first-mission
  test. File creation and save isolation have been tested; a complete save/load
  gameplay round trip has not.
- Investigate translation coverage where execution requires it: the generator
  reports 50 unresolved direct-call targets emitted as diagnostic stubs, plus
  730 unsupported instruction occurrences emitted as comments/no-ops across
  30 mnemonics. Zero translation failures does not imply equivalent behavior.
- Check rendering and audio fidelity against the original game. Captured menu
  frames and host audio submissions are narrower evidence than a full playtest.
- Keyboard/mouse support currently targets player 1's first-person gameplay.
  Vehicle aiming, split-screen, MapMaker mouse navigation and extended hardware
  playtests remain unverified. Focus/capture behavior has automated state and
  activation-policy checks; no physical mouse/Alt-Tab playtest was performed.
- Aim/crouch toggle behavior follows the original game's profile. Mouse
  sensitivity/inversion is controlled by the PC configuration, independently
  of controller turn speed. The supplied PC profile selects keyboard input;
  controller input requires a controller binding configuration.
- Multiplayer and online behavior have not been tested here.

The generated C is a machine-code translation, not recovered original source.
Runtime code is pinned upstream; no claim of a completed decompilation or a
finished PC release is made.

## Interactive launcher correction (2026-10-15)

Normal play now launches through `tools/play.py`, which waits for the game and
writes its output directly to `logs/play-*.out` and `logs/play-*.err` using native
file handles. Interactive runs disable the generated code's default 400,000-line
function trace; diagnostic profiling remains available through SmokeTest.
The previous PowerShell GUI launch could return before the game, and inherited
or redirected output could stall startup. The corrected normal launch produced
captured startup logos and advancing swaps, with keyboard/mouse configuration
loaded. The user also confirmed that the logos appeared. Main-menu and gameplay
interaction for this hardware playtest is still to be tried.

## PC controls menu (2026-10-15)

Added a PC Settings → Keyboard & Mouse entry to the native game window's menu
bar, with F2 access in windowed and fullscreen modes. The owned settings dialog
lists all 24 Xbox actions with four keyboard/mouse binding slots each, mouse
sensitivity, inversion, mouse enable/disable, defaults, and Cancel. Capture
supports keys, five mouse buttons, and wheel directions; conflicting assignments
can be moved after confirmation. F1/F2/F9–F11 and Windows keys are reserved.
Gameplay input is blocked while editing, but simulation is not paused: pause
the mission first.

Saving applies bindings and mouse options immediately. Polls copy an immutable
binding snapshot under an SRW lock; editor input cannot become gameplay input.
Configuration changes preserve other ports and unrelated JSON members. Writes
use a temporary sibling file and atomic replacement, retaining the previous
configuration as `.bak`; failed writes retain the active bindings. Build checks
use a separate default fixture so user-customized bindings do not affect tests.

Validation: native input and save-path suites passed, as did the new settings
suite for live sampling, persistence and fresh-process reload, backup, unrelated
JSON retention, read-only failure, invalid values/reserved keys, defaults, native
dialog Cancel, key/wheel capture, and conflict reassignment. The UI was rendered
and visually inspected. A bounded real-game integration check verified both
entry points, F2 in fullscreen, input ownership/return, rendering after closing,
and that Cancel left the user's file unchanged. Both patches reproduced all
seven modified upstream files from pristine pinned sources. Evidence is in
`logs/pc-settings-release-validation.log` and `logs/pc-settings-game-tests.log`.

## In-game menu integration reverted (2026-10-15)

At the user's request, removed both the original-menu entry and the subsequent
game-rendered editing pages. Restored the original Xbox Settings/Options menus.
Keyboard/mouse gameplay controls, the separate F2 / PC Settings editor, and
user bindings/saves remain. Integration source is archived under
`private/rollback-in-game-menu`; generated code and the executable are rebuilt
without the guest menu wrapper or callback hooks.

Rollback validation: regeneration and Release build succeeded; save-path, PC
input/camera, and settings suites passed. A real-game UI check verified F2,
the PC Settings menu, and F2 in fullscreen; closing the editor returned input
and rendering to the game. The user configuration hash is unchanged. Logs:
`logs/revert-menu-build.log`, `logs/revert-menu-settings-ui.log`.
